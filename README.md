chuckchvrches
=============
A ChucK script for use with Xbox joystick that does some funky stuff. Being built for a potential live cover of Chvrches "The Mother We Share"

To use:
1) Open the script and change file path to the wav files assigned to sounds[]
2) Run the script (command line or miniaudicle)
3) Remap if ya want?

Current features (will probably expand as need/want arises)
-A/B/X/Y buttons work as pads controlling samples of the Lauren Mayberry "Oh" bit at the beginning of the song
-Left and right triggers work as pitch shifters, left shifting up an octave, and right shifting down an octave. I'd like to make these better though: they're kinda gross atm.
